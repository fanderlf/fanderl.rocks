    <h1>Article 1: Creating a static web page that is hosted on S3</h1>
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
      Well in order to start a blog, you need something that you can show on the web. The easiest things that you can
      put into the web is a single html page without any styling. To not get lost in layout/design in the very first
      step, I
      really wanted to just throw out some content. There are already a few things that we have to do:
    <ol>
      <li>write the content into an html file</li>
      <li>be able to test the page locally</li>
      <li>put it on S3 and make it publicly available</li>
      <li>get a domain, so that we can be found easily</li>
      <li>summary</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <h3>1. write the content into an html file</h3>
    <p>
    <p>
      HTML was invented to create structured documents that can be accessed via the internet. If you want more
      information head over to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Wikipedia</a> or <a
        href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=html">Google</a>. Browsers know how to interpret specific elements called
      'Tags' and how to display them. The basic structure of an html looks like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code><BR>
        &lt;html&gt;<BR>
        &nbsp;&lt;head&gt;<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;Title that is displayed in the browser tab&lt;/title&gt;<BR>
        &nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;<BR>
        &nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;Headline&lt;/h1&gt;<BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;paragraph&lt;/p&gt;<BR>
        &nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<BR>
        &lt;/html&gt;<BR>
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Html files consist of a tree of blocks. The outermost block is the <code>html</code> block, which denotes that the
      data in this file is an html document. A block is denoted by a start tag like<code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and an end
      tag like <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>. Our html block has two children as the <code>head</code> and
      <code>body</code>
      block are called. The head block contains the pages title. Itusually also holds references to other resources to
      be loaded (e.g. javascript or css files). The<code>body</code> block contains the visible content of our page.
      Amongst other block we use <code>h1</code>to create a headline or the <code>p</code> block to create paragraphs in
      our page. If you want to find outmore about the other tags I used in this document, go visit <a
        href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">W3Schools HTML tag list</a>
    </p>
    </p>
    <h3>2. Be able to test the page locally</h3>
    <p>
      In order to be able to test the page locally in a proper way, you need a web server. Some browsers have problems
      displaying pages from the file system (e.g. path to a file on your disk). So I decided to spin up nginx locally
      using docker and use it a web server that serves static web pages. We won't dive too deep into the topic, because
      there are quite some elements involved, that would need a lot of explanation. But I'll provide a short guide to
      get
      it running.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>Install docker desktop</summary>
          First we need to install docker desktop on your computer. You can find the download and instructions
          a <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">here</a>
        </details>
      </li>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>Run nginx without any configuration</summary>
          Now we want to run nginx without any configuration just to see if it works. Execute this from your terminal:
          <code>docker run --name mynginx1 -p 80:80 -d nginx</code> Don't forget to start docker before running this
          command. If you go to your browser and type in <code>http://localhost</code> you should see the default nginx
          start page.
        </details>
      </li>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>Configure nginx to serve pages from the content folder</summary>
          <p>
            Of course it's not very exciting to just show the default nginx start page. In order to change this we need
            to properly set up nginx. For now we just want to show the static content from our content folder, so we
            will
            stick with the default configuration. All files in'/usr/share/nginx/html' will be served as static content.
            So we will run the default nginxdocker image and mount our content folder at the static content location.
            This is how to run it:
          </p>
          <p><code>
                docker run --name nginx_fanderl_rocks --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/content,target=/usr/share/nginx/html,readonly -p 80:80 -d nginx
              </code></p>
          <p>
            <code>--name nginx_fanderl_rocks</code>: name of the docker container on your local computer
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>--mount type=bind,source=./content,target=/usr/share/nginx/html,readonly</code>: this statement tells
            docker to mount the local folder ./content, which holds our static web pages, tothe folder that holds static
            html files by default in nginx.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>-p 80:80</code>: this statement tells docker to publis the port 80 through the docker host. This makes
            it possible that you can type <code>localhost</code> into your browser and seethe nginx default start page.
            Port 80 is the default port for http, the default web protocol
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>-d</code>: tells docker to run as detached process, thus will not respond to stdin anymore. It will
            also not block your terminal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>nginx</code>: tells docker to use the nginx docker image from <a
              href="https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx">docker hub</a>
          </p>
        </details>
      </li>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>Test page in your local browser</summary>
          If you enter <a href="http://localhost/"><code>http://localhost/</code></a> in your browser you will see the
          page from the content folder rendered in your browser. Notice that the filename after the domain resembles the
          filename of the file in order content folder. Something worth noting is that just typing
          <code>localhost</code>
          into some browsers will not work, because the default protocol for most browser has changed from http to https
          and we did not have set up serving pages using https. https is the encrypted version of http. The default
          configuration for nginx also allows us touse index.html as the root page of our homepage. So http://localhost/
          andhttp://localhost/index.html will show you the same content.
        </details>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>3. Put it on s3 and make it publicly accessible</h3>
    <p>
      In order to make our webpage accessible from the public internet, we need to make our files publicly available.
      For this purpose I choose to go with a very simple approach, which is putting files onto <ahref="https:
        //aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3 (<b>S</b>imple <b>S</b>torage <b>S</b>ervice)</a>. If configured correctly and it
        can serve static webpages like ours, without the need for a dedicated server.
    </p>
    <h4>Infrastructure as code</h4>
    <p>
      Setting up your infrastructure quickly and in a reproducable fashion has become the industry standard through the
      past few years. Thanks to cloud services that have awesome APIs, this has become increasingly easier in the last
      years. Since we use AWS there are a few options that we could use to setup our resources:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>Cloudformation</summary>
          <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">Cloudformation</a> is the most basic way that Amazon provides
          to provision resources in AWS. Cloudformation resources are organised in stacks, where each stack is described
          by a template written in json or yaml.
        </details>
      </li>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>AWS Cloud Development Kit</summary>
          <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/?">AWS CDK</a> builds on top of cloudformation. Aside from the basic
          cloudformation resource called L1 constructs, it offers L2 constructs. L2 constructs are L1 constructs with a
          usefull set of sensible defaults, so most of the L2 constructs are easier to use. There are even higher level
          components called patterns, which use multiple constructs from the other levels to complete even bigger tasks.
        </details>
      </li>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>Terraform</summary>
          <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> is a cloud agnostic tool to manage resources. It's similar
          to cloudformation in what it does, but it can handle multiple clouds. You can even pass parameters from one
          cloud to the other. It's also not restricted to cloud, you can use it to deploy/manage anything.
        </details>
      </li>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>AWS CLI</summary>
          <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI</a> is a command line based tool to access AWS. There are also
          approaches where people manage their cloud resources using AWS CLI via shell scripts.
        </details>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For this blog I will go with AWS CDK. I personally think having sensible defaults is very valuable. I'm also not
      the biggest fan of terraform, because I like to have the state of the deployment tool inside the cloud I'm using.
      It's a great tool when you have to deal with managing things across clouds or maybe even on premise. Since we will
      only do AWS for now and I want to learn AWS CDK we will stick with that.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>Installing the AWS CDK</summary>
          I used <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/hello_world.html">this guide from AWS</a> to
          setup AWS CDK. I did not install it globally, as I'm not a big fan of bloating the global nodejs installation.
          Instead I created the <code>cdk</code> folder that will just hold the installation of the cdk. That way it
          will be found by all the CDK apps that will be hosted inside this folder.

          <summary>Creating infrastructure CDK app</summary>
          By using <code>cdk init infrastructure --language typescript</code> we create a new CDK stack that will

          <summary>Create a stack for our public S3 bucket</summary>
          <a
            href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html">This
            guide</a> explains how to setup static website hosting using S3. It says that we need two S3 buckets that
          are
          publicly accessible from the internet. Those S3 buckets must match the domain name we want to have. This is
          the resulting stack defined in our CDK application: <code><br>
export class FanderlRocksStack extends Stack {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;super(scope, id, props);<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const subdomain = 'www';<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const domainName = 'fanderl.rocks';<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const root_bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'fanderl_rocks_domain_root_bucket', {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;versioned: false,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bucketName: domainName,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;websiteIndexDocument: 'index.html',<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;publicReadAccess: true,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const subdomain_bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'fanderl_rocks_subdomain_bucket', {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;versioned: false,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bucketName: `${subdomain}.${domainName}`,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;websiteRedirect: {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hostName: domainName<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});<br>
}<br>
</code>
        </details>
      </li>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>Upload the content to S3</summary>
          <p>
            In order to be able to access our files from S3, we have to upload them to the bucket. There are several
            ways to upload files to an S3 bucket. The simplest one is probably to use the AWS CLI. You can upload files
            by executing the following statement from the root folder of this repository:
          </p>
          <p>

            <code>aws s3 sync content/ s3://fanderl.rocks</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            The other method I stumbled across when searching how to setup S3 buckets with CDK, is to use CDK to upload
            files. I chose to use this approach, because there's nothing extra we need to maintain. CDK is a little bit
            slowish, if you need to do it often. But I think it's good enough as a start and I want to give it a try.
            Here's the code from our stack:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>
new s3Deployment.BucketDeployment(this, 'fanderl_rocks_static_website_content', {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sources: [s3Deployment.Source.asset('../../content')],<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;destinationBucket: root_bucket<br>
});
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we can test that our page can be accessed through the public internet via its <a
              href="https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/fanderl.rocks/index.html">S3 URL -
              https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/fanderl.rocks/index.html</a>.
          </p>
        </details>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>4. Get a domain</h3>
    <p>
      In order to not have a cryptic IP or S3 specific URL we want to get a domain, so that users can just type
      http://fanderl.rocks into their browser and find our website. In order to do this, we need to register the domain
      for ourselves and pay a little fee, so that someone redirects us to our website, whenever somebody types the above
      URL into the browser. The protocol behind this is called <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS - Domain Name System</a>. Here's what I did to
      register the for the content in S3:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>Buy the domain</summary>
          The first step is to buy the domain and secure it for yourself. This is pretty much straight forward
          and something that can't be done with CDK. So I will just post <a
            href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html">this AWS guide</a>
          that shows you how do this in the AWS console.
        </details>
      </li>

      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>Add DNS ARecords so that users will be redirected to our S3 bucket to our CDK stack</summary>
          An ARecord is an entry in the registry of the DNS provider that tells the Browser a specific IP address, when
          queried for the domain. One can also register subdomains like e.g. <code>www.fanderl.rocks</code>.
          <code>
const hosted_zone = route53.HostedZone.fromLookup(this, 'fanderl_rocks_hosted_zone', {domainName});<br>
<br>
new route53.ARecord(this, 'fanderl_rocks_root_a_record', {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;zone: hosted_zone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;target: route53.RecordTarget.fromAlias(new targets.BucketWebsiteTarget(root_bucket))<br>
});<br>
<br>
new route53.ARecord(this, 'fanderl_rocks_subdmain_a_record', {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;zone: hosted_zone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;recordName: subdomain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;target: route53.RecordTarget.fromAlias(new targets.BucketWebsiteTarget(subdomain_bucket))<br>
});<br>
</code>
        </details>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>5. Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Holy, that was a lot of stuff to do and digest. But finally we arrived and have static content delivered on our
      own custom domain. That's something that we can be very proud. So let's quickly go to <a
        href="http://fanderl.rocks">fanderl.rocks</a> and have a relaxing cup of coffee that we earnt ourselves.
