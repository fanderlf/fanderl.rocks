          <h3>Who am I?</h3> My name is Florian Fanderl and I'm a software developer based in munich. I grew up in a
          small town in bavaria and moved to munich 10 years ago. Professionally writing software is my passion. My goal
          is to write solid software in the most simple way. Technology or methods that I like using: <ul class="ps-3">

          <h3>What did I do professionally?</h3> 
          <p>I started my software development career at Continental Temic GmbH in Ingolstadt.
          There I was building inhouse systems in Borland C++ and C#.</p>
          <p>My next stop was C#/.Net developer at AutoScout24 GmbH. I started in the search funnel team as a C# developer.
            One of the highlights during this time definitely was the migration to Elasticsearch as search index. Later 
            on I switched to the car dealer area, evolving the experience of car dealers on the platform. One significant
            achievement there was building a new ad product booking backend using DDD/event sourcing. Afterwards we moved 
            to a new stack, where we built a new statistics backend in (nearly) serverless AWS using Scala/Java.
          </p>
          <p>During my time at Siemens/Yunex I was working on a system to control intersections using machine learning (flowAI)
            and an emissions dashboard for the city of Wiesbaden (Digi-V). All the applications we built were using Python as a 
            programming language and always used continuous delivery for deployment. FlowAI ran in docker containers in a 
            Kubernetes cluster in Azure. Digi-V is a big data application that uses Spark on AWS S3 as a backend and Tableau
            as Frontend.

          <h3>What do I do otherwise?</h3>
          <p>When I'm not working I enjoy going to the mountains, climbing (mostly indoor), good food, reading, playing computer and board games with my friends.</p>
