  <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    Hi!
  </p>
  Great that you made it to my blog. This blog is a hobby project of myself and a place to play around with various
  technologies. The idea is to create more and more articles that explain how I created and evolved this blog over time.
  The hope is that this helps and inspires other people on any skill level. The full code for this blog can be found at
  any point in time on <a href="https://github.com/fanderlf/fanderl.rocks">github.com/fanderlf/fanderl.rocks</a>.

    About the style: I really like to iterate when I work. That's also how I will proceed with this blog. Start with the
    most minimalistic thing that improves something. Focus on it and get it live quickly. After that tackle the next
    problem. All of the articles will have a very clear goal I try to achieve and the article will explain what I did to
    achieve that goal and also some of the thoughts why I decided to go for a certain solution. Maybe there will also be
    an outlook, if I do already have some follow up topics in mind. So let's go and see where thejourney will lead us.
