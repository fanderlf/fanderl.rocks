      <h1>Motivation</h1>
      <p>I'd like to let you know the reasons why this blog exists and also some principles that I'd like to follow
        while creating articles for this blog.</p>
      <h2>Evolve</h2>
      <p>This is probably the main reason why I started this blog. I always wanted to have a blog, but I never found
        good content to put onto the web. Then I thought, why not make the blog itself the content. So a lot of articles
        will be around the creation of this website. The idea is also to keep all the articles in the form they first
        appeared on this blog. Even if I decide to change the current state of the blog, I try to keep a reference to
        the state of the blog by the time it was created. This is typically a link to a git commit, that you can find in
        the footer of the article. </p>
      <h2>Small steps</h2>
      <p>Creating something like this website can be a bit overwhelming at first, especially when you want to start from
        scratch. I could of course have used wordpress or something along those lines, but I really like the idea of
        beginning minimal and improving things over time. That's why I created simple static html pages on S3 first.
        Over time I will improve the visuals, the technology behind and also the capabilities of this blog. I will try
        to do as little steps as possible to not overwhelm poeple with new content and also to keep me focussed at the
        task at hand. For me iterating quickly in small steps is crucial.</p>
      <h2>Learn</h2>
      <p>Learning new stuff is something that I really like. Sometimes you want to try out this new programming language
        or that new tool you found on the web. Whenever I find something interesting and I'd like to try it out, I will
        create something new for the blog. As an example there's already AWS CDK, which I never used in my daily work.
        Another idea could be to serve an article from a webserver using a programming language I want to learn. So this
        blog will be my personal playground. </p>
      <h2>Knowledge dump</h2>
      <p>Whenever I learnt something new at work or maybe created something that I think is worth sharing, I will also
        put it onto this page. Everybody knows these things that you create at work, that you're really proud of. Be it
        this super cool automation script or a really good abstraction of something that you think others should also be
        using. </p>
      <h2>Book reviews</h2>
      <p>It's a fact that I read a lot of books. From all the formats available to gain new knowledge, this is probably
        my preferred one. There are so many awesome books out there ready to be recommended. </p>
      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <p>If you do have thoughts or comments on the things I read, don't hesitate to contact me. I really appreciate
        constructive feedback. You can reach out to me via EMail to florian(dot)fanderl(at)gmail(dot)com or on <a
